# MCMC
This repository contains the Monti-Carlo Simulation based on Metropolis–Hastings (MH) and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC).
I've used random walker to solve two problem:
1. Using MCMC algorithm to estimate cosmological parameters from supernova Ia data.
2. Using MCMC code to analyse photographic plates from Eddington’s 1919 eclipse expedition, to determine whether the data favour Newtonian gravity or Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity.
